The question gave us a simple open circuit. None of the resistors were either in series or parallel as neither the current through nor the voltage across them were equal. It had two DC current sources, one voltage source and one current source. One could easily solve the circuit by using nodal analysis, which is also called the KCL. Any variation if present in simulated and calculated values can only be explained by human error in calculation. The errors produced has been tabulated.
